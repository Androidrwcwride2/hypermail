   SECURITY WARNING: Do not put hypermail's output anyplace where a web
   server might have server side includes (SSI) enabled, unless you are sure
   you know what you are doing. If in doubt, check your web server
   configuration. If you are using Apache, look for an Options line
   that mentions Includes or IncludesNOEXEC. The author of an email
   normally has substantial control over what files hypermail creates,
   particularly via attachments. Hypermail is designed to insure that
   filenames don't end in .shtml and don't contain characters like / or \,
   which prevent some security problems, but there are few restrictions
   on what can go in a file (e.g. possibly malicious html tags - try the
   "text_types = *" option if you want to restrict this).

Before Building Hypermail:
==========================

   Hypermail now uses "configure" to generate the Makefiles. In the
   top level directory, type "configure" to create the Makefiles.
   If it does not work on your system, please let me know. 

Building Hypermail:
===================

   Hypermail has been normally compiled and run on Unix-based systems
   in the past. Today it can be configured and built using Cygwin 
   software.  I have either compiled and tested this code successfully 
   on the following platforms or others have told me of their success.

        Solaris 2.5.x, SunOS 4.1.3, FreeBSD 2.2.5, FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE,
        BSDI/3.x, Linux kernel 2.0.18 and 2.0.30, Redhat 5.x && 6.x,
        NT using CygWin-b19 <http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32>,
        Irix6.2, HP-UX 10.20, SCO OS 5.0.5

   For more information on Cygwin and build hypermail on a Windows-based 
   system, see the file docs/Install-win32.txt.  

   Generic Build:

    1) Type "./configure". This creates the makefiles and the
       config.h file needed to build the software.

    2) Type "make". This will build the software. You can test
       it locally and when you are ready to install it ...

 On some systems you may need to add "-R/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib"
to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefiles, or alter your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable (Willi Kernen reports that on a 64-bit Solaris,
changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to:
/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/ucb/lib:/usr/openwin/lib
fixed a problem).

Testing Hypermail:
==================

    If you wish to test the new hypermail before installing it

       	- chdir to tests/

	- copy a mailbox you have to a local file named "testmail"

	- type "sh ./testhm"

    This will generate an archive under a newly created "testdir/"
    directory.  Check it out with your favorite browser.

    When you are done testing, 

        - remove the testdir directory,

        - remove the testmail file.

    (See the README in tests/ for more information.)

Installing Hypermail:
=====================

    Now that you are ready to install Hypermail, 

        - chdir to the src/ directory

        - Type "make install". 

Building cgi-bin/mail:
======================

    A small CGI program, "mail", is included with this source
    for you to use with Hypermail. To compile and install it:

    1) Edit the Makefile and change the variable "cgidir" to
       point to the directory that holds your site's CGI programs.

    2) Type "make mail" to compile the mail program.

    3) Type "make mail.install" to install the program in your
       CGI directory. 

Documentation:
==============

    To install the HTML documentation:

    1) Edit the Makefile and change "htmldir" to point to the
       directory in which you want the documentation.

    2) Type "make html.install". You should be able to view the
       HTML documentation using any World-Wide Web browser.
