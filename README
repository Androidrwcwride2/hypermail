                             Hypermail

                          Version:  2.1

This is a release of the 2.1 version of hypermail.

Please refer to Changelog for the list of changes made to this release.

Hypermail is a program that takes a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox
format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents. 

Hypermail Background:
=====================

Hypermail was originally designed and developed by Tom Gruber for
Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT) using Common Lisp. 

It was later rewritten in C by Kevin Hughes in 1994 while Kevin 
worked at EIT. 

License Evolution:
------------------

In the spring of 1997, Kevin Hughes heavily pressed Hewlett-Packard
(who was now the legal owner of Hypermail, since EIT was bought by
VeriFone, which was bought by Hewlett-Packard) into placing a free
software license onto his old EIT software.  They officially put the
GNU license on *all* of Kevin's old EIT software, opening it up to
more open methods of development and distribution. So now Hypermail
is under GNU.

EIT's net.disappearance:
------------------------

A very old and established government contractor company called 
Electronic Instrumentation and Technology Inc. made legal moves to 
obtain the eit.com domain. Since VeriFone/HP had no interest in keeping 
EIT, dissolved it completely.  As this company had a trademark on EIT, 
the domain name was given to them. Elizabeth Batson of EIT/VeriFone/HP 
informed Kevin he could maintain all his old software himself wherever 
he wished to put it.

Kevin and ongoing Hypermail Development:
----------------------------------------

Kevin left Hewlett-Packard in 1997 and helped form a new company 
called Veo Systems (www.veosystems.com) with his old boss Marty 
Tenenbaum, who founded EIT. Kevin did not have the time to maintain 
any of his old software, so he was looking for different parties to 
help maintain it and take over different pieces. For instance, Getstats 
has been obsoleted by Analog (http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/). 
SWISH has been taken over by the SWISH-E project 
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/) and many people have been doing 
good things with it.  April 17, 1998 Kevin passed hypermail development 
to Kent Landfield (http://www.landfield.com/hypermail/). Kent had been 
supporting an enhanced version of hypermail he had been using for the 
last few years.

General:
========

Hypermail 1.02 was the last supported version of hypermail until recently. 
This is the start of its rebirth as a supported, publically available tool.

This version has been tested on the platforms listed below. If you would 
like to send portability patches or confirmation that it works on a certain
platform, please do.  There should not be toooo many changes that need to be 
made.

This version of hypermail allows an administrator to customize the header
and footers to match their local needs.  This allows you to have hypermail 
facilities better integrated into your web site. 

This version is an integration of patches that Kevin had received through
the years, and new features through the individual efforts many people.  
This has been run through lint, Insight and Purify and has been cleaned up 
accordingly. There are still some minor issues that will be cleaned up
shortly. 

   * archive - general archive utilites that are useful in managing
               list archives. It is expected that some of the functionality
               in msg2archive.c will find it's way into future versions of 
               hypermail,
   * contrib - contributed hypermail relate utilities
   * configs - sample hypermail configuration files,
   * docs    - documentation and documentation support files,
   * libcgi  - support library for the mail utility,
   * src     - here's the beef,
   * tests   - directory for supporting local testing,

Before Building Hypermail:
==========================

   * Hypermail now uses "configure" to generate the Makefiles. In the
     top level directory, type "configure" to create the Makefiles.
     If it does not work on your system, please let me know. 

   * Additional utilities have been added to support maintaining hypermail
     and Unix mailbox archives side-by-side.  The tools can be very useful.
     See the archive/README for additional information. It is expected that 
     the functionality of msg2archive.c will be merged into hypermail in 
     the future.

Building Hypermail:
===================

   Hypermail has been normally compiled and run on Unix-based systems
   in the past. Today it can be configured and built using Cygwin 
   software.  I have either compiled and tested this code successfully 
   on the following platforms or others have told me of their success.

        Solaris 2.5.x, SunOS 4.1.3, FreeBSD 2.2.5, FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE,
        BSDI/3.x, Linux kernel 2.0.18 and 2.0.30, Redhat 5.x && 6.x,
        NT using CygWin-b19 <http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32>,
        Irix6.2, HP-UX 10.20, SCO OS 5.0.5

   For more information on Cygwin and build hypermail on a Windows-based 
   system, see the file docs/Install-win32.txt.  

   Generic Build:

    1) Type "./configure". This creates the makefiles and the
       config.h file needed to build the software.

    2) Type "make". This will build the software. You can test
       it locally and when you are ready to install it ...

 On some systems you may need to add "-R/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib"
to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefiles, or alter your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable (Willi Kernen reports that on a 64-bit Solaris,
changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to:
/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/ucb/lib:/usr/openwin/lib
fixed a problem).

Testing Hypermail:
==================

    If you wish to test the new hypermail before installing it

       	- chdir to tests/

	- copy a mailbox you have to a local file named "testmail"

	- type "sh ./testhm"

    This will generate an archive under a newly created "testdir/"
    directory.  Check it out with your favorite browser.

    When you are done testing, 

        - remove the testdir directory,

        - remove the testmail file.

    (See the README in tests/ for more information.)

Installing Hypermail:
=====================

    Now that you are ready to install Hypermail, 

        - chdir to the src/ directory

        - Type "make install". 

Building cgi-bin/mail:
======================

    A small CGI program, "mail", is included with this source
    for you to use with Hypermail. To compile and install it:

    1) Edit the Makefile and change the variable "cgidir" to
       point to the directory that holds your site's CGI programs.

    2) Type "make mail" to compile the mail program.

    3) Type "make mail.install" to install the program in your
       CGI directory. 

Documentation:
==============

    To install the HTML documentation:

    1) Edit the Makefile and change "htmldir" to point to the
       directory in which you want the documentation.

    2) Type "make html.install". You should be able to view the
       HTML documentation using any World-Wide Web browser. 

    The latest, most up-to-date Hypermail documentation can be found at:

Warning:
========

Take the time to read the KNOWN_BUGS file so that you are aware of 
things that might affect your use of hypermail.

CVS Server:
===========

Thanks to Ashley M. Kirchner <ashley@pcraft.com>, we have a CVS 
server with the most recent sources at all times. Study the file
README.CVS for details in how to use it.

UPDATE: April 29th, the CVS server got switched to a different machine.
        Please pay attention to the new path locations (from README.CVS)

Getting Help:
=============

    Please send all bug reports, feature requests, patches, and other 
    program-related things to 

		hypermail-bugs@landfield.com.

    The Hypermail Development mailing list (hypermail@landfield.com) is 
    a good place to ask questions about usage, potential bugs, or to talk 
    about features you'd like to see.  The list is a majordomo-based list.
    To subscribe send a message to majordomo@landfield.com with 

                  "subscribe hypermail" 

    (minus the quotes) as the body of the message. The Subject: line 
    is ignored.  The list's submission address is hypermail@landfield.com.

    If you would simply like to be alerted to important Hypermail 
    announcements and don't wish to follow the development list's 
    traffic you can subscribe to the Hypermail Announcements list. 
    That is a very low traffic moderated list intended for announcements 
    only (concerning new releases or patches). This too is a majordomo
    based list so to subscribe, send a message to majordomo@landfield.com 
    with
                "subscribe hypermail-announce"

    as the body of the message.
