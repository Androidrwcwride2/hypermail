                             Hypermail

                          Version:  2.1

This is a release of the 2.1 version of hypermail.

Hypermail is a program that takes a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox
format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents. 

SECURITY WARNING: Do not put hypermail's output anyplace where a web server
might have server side includes (SSI) enabled unless you are sure you know
what you are doing. Avoid the crappy program called "mail" that comes with
hypermail.

See the INSTALL file to get started. For a description of how to use it,
see the hypermail.html, hmrc.html, and hypermail-faq.html files that come
in the docs/ directory.
Please refer to Changelog for the list of recent changes.

Hypermail is distributed under the GNU GPL license (see the file COPYING for
details). Some programs that are distributed with it in the archive and
contrib directories have different licenses - check the individual files for
details.

Hypermail Background:
=====================

Hypermail was originally designed and developed by Tom Gruber for
Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT) using Common Lisp. 

It was later rewritten in C by Kevin Hughes in 1994 while Kevin 
worked at EIT. 

License Evolution:
------------------

In the spring of 1997, Kevin Hughes heavily pressed Hewlett-Packard
(who was now the legal owner of Hypermail, since EIT was bought by
VeriFone, which was bought by Hewlett-Packard) into placing a free
software license onto his old EIT software.  They officially put the
GNU GPL license on *all* of Kevin's old EIT software, opening it up to
more open methods of development and distribution. So now Hypermail
is under GPL.

EIT's net.disappearance:
------------------------

A very old and established government contractor company called 
Electronic Instrumentation and Technology Inc. made legal moves to 
obtain the eit.com domain. Since VeriFone/HP had no interest in keeping 
EIT, dissolved it completely.  As this company had a trademark on EIT, 
the domain name was given to them. Elizabeth Batson of EIT/VeriFone/HP 
informed Kevin he could maintain all his old software himself wherever 
he wished to put it.

Kevin and ongoing Hypermail Development:
----------------------------------------

Kevin left Hewlett-Packard in 1997 and helped form a new company 
called Veo Systems (www.veosystems.com) with his old boss Marty 
Tenenbaum, who founded EIT. Kevin did not have the time to maintain 
any of his old software, so he was looking for different parties to 
help maintain it and take over different pieces. For instance, Getstats 
has been obsoleted by Analog (http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/). 
SWISH has been taken over by the SWISH-E project 
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/) and many people have been doing 
good things with it.  April 17, 1998 Kevin passed hypermail development 
to Kent Landfield (http://www.hypermail.org/). Kent had been 
supporting an enhanced version of hypermail he had been using for the 
last few years.

General:
========

This version has been tested on the platforms listed below. If you would 
like to send portability patches or confirmation that it works on a certain
platform, please do.  There should not be toooo many changes that need to be 
made.

This version of hypermail has substantial support for attachments and for
splitting archives into subdirectories. It also allows an administrator to
customize the header and footers to match their local needs.  This allows
you to have hypermail facilities better integrated into your web site. 

This version is an integration of patches that Kevin had received through
the years, and new features through the individual efforts many people.  
This has been run through lint, Insight and Purify and has been cleaned up 
accordingly.

   * archive - general archive utilites that are useful in managing
               list archives. Much of the functionality here has been
               rendered obsolete by the folder_by_date option.
   * contrib - contributed hypermail relate utilities
   * configs - sample hypermail configuration files,
   * docs    - documentation and documentation support files,
   * libcgi  - support library for the mail utility,
   * src     - here's the beef,
   * tests   - directory for supporting local testing,

Warning:
========

Take the time to read the KNOWN_BUGS file so that you are aware of 
things that might affect your use of hypermail.

CVS Server:
===========

Thanks to Ashley M. Kirchner <ashley@pcraft.com>, we have a CVS 
server with the most recent sources at all times. Study the file
README.CVS for details in how to use it.

UPDATE: April 29th, the CVS server got switched to a different machine.
        Please pay attention to the new path locations (from README.CVS)

Getting Help:
=============

    Please send all bug reports, feature requests, patches, and other 
    program-related things to 

		hypermail-bugs@hypermail.org.

    The Hypermail Development mailing list (hypermail@hypermail.org) is 
    a good place to ask questions about usage, potential bugs, or to talk 
    about features you'd like to see.  The list is a majordomo-based list.
    To subscribe send a message to majordomo@hypermail.org with 

                  "subscribe hypermail" 

    (minus the quotes) as the body of the message. The Subject: line 
    is ignored.  The list's submission address is hypermail@hypermail.org.

    If you would simply like to be alerted to important Hypermail 
    announcements and don't wish to follow the development list's 
    traffic you can subscribe to the Hypermail Announcements list. 
    That is a very low traffic moderated list intended for announcements 
    only (concerning new releases or patches). This too is a majordomo
    based list so to subscribe, send a message to majordomo@hypermail.org 
    with
                "subscribe hypermail-announce"

    as the body of the message.
