<P>
The hypermail list configuration file is used to specify <EM>list 
specific</EM> information to hypermail.  Comments are denoted by the
'#' character at the begining of the line.
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>Sample Hypermail List Specific Configuration File</STRONG></P>

<P># <STRONG>mbox = [ filename | NONE ]</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># This is the default mailbox to read messages in from.  Set this 
<BR># with a value of NONE to read from standard input as the default.
<BR>#
<BR>mbox = NONE
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>ietf_mbox = [ 0 | 1 ]</STRONG>
<BR># Setting this variable to 1 will tell hypermail that the
<BR># mbox  is  formatted  according to the IETF mbox convention:
<BR># all lines, except for the envelope, are  prefixed
<BR># with a &gt; char.
<BR>ietf_mbox = 0
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>label = [ Title | NONE ]</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># This is the default title you want to call your archives.
<BR># Set this to NONE to use the name of the input mailbox.
<BR>#
<BR>label = Hypermail Development List
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>htmlsuffix = [ html | htm | shtml ... ]</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># Use this to specify the html file suffix to be used when Hypermail
<BR># generates the html files. This is dependent on local needs. Do not 
<BR># put a '.' in the value. It would result in "file..html", probably
<BR># not what you want.
<BR>#
<BR>htmlsuffix = shtml
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>language = two-letter-language-id ]</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># This is a two-letter string specifying the default
<BR># language  to  use.   Set this the value of the language
<BR># table you wish  to  use  when  running  and  generating
<BR># archives.  
<BR># 
<BR># Current supported languages:
<BR>#
<BR>#  de - German
<BR>#  en - English
<BR>#  es - Spanish
<BR>#  fi - Finnish
<BR>#  fr - French
<BR>#  is - Icelandic
<BR>#  se - Swedish
<BR>#
<BR># <STRONG> uselock  [ 0 | 1 ]</STRONG> 
<BR>#
<BR># Controls whether to use hypermail's built-in locking mechanism. 
<BR># By default, this option is set to <STRONG>1</STRONG>. Set it to 
<BR># <STRONG>0</STRONG> if you have an external locking mechanism,
<BR># like, for example, when using procmail or smartlist.
<BR>
<BR>uselock = 0
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>locktime = number-of-seconds</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># The number of seconds that a lock should be honored when processing
<BR># inbound messages before it is overridden.
<BR>
<BR>locktime = 3600
<BR>
<BR># <STRONG>usemeta  [ 0 | 1 ]</STRONG>
<BR>#
<BR># This option allows you to use metadata to store the content type
<BR># of a MIME attachments and, later on,  when a user browses the
<BR># attachment, send back this information in the HTTP Content-Type
<BR># header. When set to <STRONG>1</STRONG>, the Content-Type header of a MIME
<BR># attachment will be stored in a metadata file. 
<BR># Let us say that the MIME attachments for a message are
<BR># stored in directory <STRONG>att-num</STRONG>. The metadata for those attachments
<BR># will then be stored in  directory <STRONG>att-num/.meta</STRONG>. If a 
<BR># MIME attachment is stored in file <STRONG>att-file</STRONG>, its metadata
<BR># will be stored in file <STRONG>att-file.meta</STRONG>. This convention is 
<BR># directly compatible with the Apache server handling of metadata.

<BR>#
<BR># Setting this variable to 1 will reverse-sort the article
<BR># entries in the date and thread index files by the date they 
<BR># were received. That is, the most recent  messages  will  appear 
<BR># at the top of the index rather than the other way around.
<BR># Set to 0 if you want latest message on the bottom for date and
